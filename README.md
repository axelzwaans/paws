# UX

## User stories

Before starting this project, I thought about how this software application might provide value to a user. Using agile methodology, I identified a set of user stories and used GitHub projects to document them. I tagged them either as 'must have' (this is functionality which my app has) or 'could have' (functionality which my app doesn't have, but would be a good feature.)

### General, colour, font

This app has been styled using React Bootstrap. The colour scheme was inspired by a cool color pallete I found which matched the type of style I wanted for this project. I kept the design very simple, focusing on functionality and user-friendliness. I used 'Roboto' as the main font in the app because of its simple and elegant style. I chose 'Sans-Serif' as a backup in case the primary font is unable to load.
